I'm a self-taught developer, who strives to efficient and user-friendly applications that provide a seamless and intuitive experience for the end-users. My expertise in front-end development includes using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build interactive user interfaces, as well as modern development tools such as Tailwind CSS for efficient styling, Sass for organized CSS, and TypeScript for scalable and maintainable code. Additionally, I have proficiency on popular frameworks such as React and Next.js for building dynamic and scalable web applications.</p>
                <p className="text-justify">In addition to front-end development, my knowledge extends into back-end development with the usage of Node.js, and relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. I am also skilled in web scraping and automation, using Python to create scripts that can quickly gather and process data.</p>
                <p className="text-justify">Overall, I am a detail-oriented problem solver with a strong work ethic and a passion for creating high-quality, efficient, and user-focused applications. I am always eager to learn new technologies and frameworks to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving tech landscape, and constantly strive to improve my skills and knowledge. If you are looking for a dedicated and motivated developer who can bring value, I would love to hear from you.</p>
